## Baseline

## SVM (Mediapipe)
  Command used: py -3.8 -m project_mediapipe_and_svm_v1.py <br />
  The above command uses Python v3.8.
## BiLSTM+CNN
  Since this is an ipynb file, just run the cells one by one. Uses Python v3.11
  May need to change folder paths when loading data, and might need to do pip install for missing imports (probably Optuna)

## SVM (MobileNet)
  Command used: py -3.8 -m project_mobilenet_and_svm_v2.py <br />
  The above command uses Python v3.8.
## LSTM
  Command used: py -3.8 -m project_lstm_v3.py <br />
  The above command uses Python v3.8.
## XGBoost
